## Autoencoder Projects

### 1. `AutoencoderMnist.py`
**Description**:  
This script implements a vanilla autoencoder using both a linear model and a CNN model on the MNIST dataset.

**Features**:
- Works with both linear and CNN models.
- Trains and evaluates on the MNIST dataset.

### 2. `DeepAutoencodeCifar10.py`
**Description**:  
This script is another vanilla autoencoder designed to work with a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It also includes functionality to visualize reconstruction errors.

**Features**:
- Trains and evaluates using a CNN model on CIFAR-10 data.
- Visualizes reconstruction errors.
- Supports training and evaluation using pre-trained files with four different latent dimensions found in saved_models folder.
